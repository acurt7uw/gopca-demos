GO-PCA Demos
============

This repository contains `GO-PCA`__ demos in the form of `Jupyter`__ (formerly IPython) notebooks. Please use the `nbviewer`__ links for each demo below to view the notebooks online. (The notebooks can also be previewed directly on GitHub. However, unlike nbviewer, GitHub does not render the plotly figures embedded in the notebooks, which somewhat defeats their purpose.)
