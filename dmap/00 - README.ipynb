    "### Overview\n",
    "In this demo, [GO-PCA](https://github.com/flo-compbio/gopca) ([Wagner, 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143196)) is applied to the `DMAP` dataset ([Novershtern et al., 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21241896)). The demo consists of three Jupyter notebooks (in addition to this \"README\" notebook) that are organized as follows:\n",
    "- 01: Downloading the required data\n",
    "- 02: Pre-processing the expression data\n",
    "- 03: Running GO-PCA and examining/visualizing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Notebooks 01 and 02 are dealing with technical issues not directly related to GO-PCA, the actual demo is contained in **Notebook 03**. Notebooks 01 and 02 are included in this demo for completeness and to allow users to re-run the demo locally (see below). Each notebook contains of multiple analysis steps. For each step, the notebook shows the commands/code executed along with the corresponding output. For more information about Jupyter notebooks, see the [Project Jupyter homepage](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-running the demo\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are inherently *executable*. It is therefore possible to re-run all the code in this demo, thereby reproducing all of the results shown. This currently requires that certain conditions are met:\n",
    "- The notebook is executed on a linux machine (since it contains bash commands and uses linux-specific commands like curl)\n",
    "- Jupyter is installed and a Jupyter server is running\n",
    "- GO-PCA is [installed](http://gopca.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may change the directories used for storing all data downloaded and generated by editing the `config.ini` file included in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback, bugs, and improvements\n",
    "Please feel free to email [Florian Wagner](mailto:florian.wagner@duke.edu) for feedback, and/or use the GitHub issue system to report bugs and suggest improvements.\n",
