    "### Overview\n",
    "In this demo, [GO-PCA](https://github.com/flo-compbio/gopca) ([Wagner, 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143196)) is applied to the `DMAP` dataset ([Novershtern et al., 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21241896)). The demo consists of a Jupyter notebook (``01 - Demo.ipynb``) that contains a series of analysis steps. For each step, the notebook shows the commands/code executed along with the corresponding output. For more information about Jupyter notebooks, see the [Project Jupyter homepage](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-running the demo\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are inherently *executable*. It is therefore possible to re-run all the code in this demo, thereby reproducing all of the results shown. Clone or download this repository, and make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is installed (preferably Python 3.5 or 3.6, but Python 2.7 should work, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GenomeTools (v0.2.1) and GO-PCA (v0.2.0) Python packages are [installed](http://gopca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). To quickly install these packages, run the following on the command line:\n",
    "      > pip install --user genometools==0.2.1 gopca==0.2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Jupyter Python package is installed and the Jupyter server is running. To quickly do this, run the following two commands on the command line:\n",
    "      > pip install --user jupyter\n",
    "      > jupyter notebook\n",
    "  The second command should open a browser window showing your file system. Browse to where you downloaded this repository and open the \"01 - Demo\" notebook. You should now be able to re-run the demo by selecting \"Cell->Run All\" from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback, bugs, and improvements\n",
    "Please feel free to email [Florian Wagner](mailto:florian.wagner@duke.edu) for feedback, and/or use the GitHub issue system to report bugs and suggest improvements.\n",
